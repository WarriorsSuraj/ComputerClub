this is where u guys should put ur html files, css files

make sure each page is it's own folder like this

/folder
    - index.html
    - style.css
    - script.js (optional but u kinda need for advanced functionality)

oh yeah also make sure its url friendly



either use JS or web assembly to code the script part (web assembly is compiled from either C++ or another language i forgot the name of, if u want to use C++ use emscripten)

use react if u want (pairs nicely with typescript backend) but make sure that it's configured correctly to work
