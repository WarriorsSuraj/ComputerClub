supervised learning
- we know the independant variable(s)
- we know the dependant variable(s)
- we know the results (through some training data)

used to predict the output for new unknown data

e.g. predicting the price of a house based on features of the house (sqr footage, year of construction, etc)
catagorizing stuff into groups 

unsupervised learning
- basically any algorithm that isnt supervised (shocker!)
- we know nothing about the data (no background information given)
- grouped by similarities

e.g. sorting emails

# SUPERVISED LEARNING

2 sub categories: classification and regression

## regression

predict a continuous numeric target variable.

## classification

assign a class to some data points



# linear regression
tries to find a linear relationship between 2 variables (input, output)

in simplest form: line of best fit!!1!1


# logistic regression
fits non linear functions to input/output data (sigmoid functions)

# k nearest neighbours
basically assigns value based on nearest neighbours on a grid.
